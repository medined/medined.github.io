I currently use SpamArrest to block spam at the server before I download messages locally. When an unknown email sender is encountered, a challenge message is sent back. Only if I authorize the sender or if the challenge message is answered does the email arrive at my local mailbox. However, I always review the suspicous messages because many people ignore the challenge message. So if I had an email client with a white list, my life might be simpler. This paragraph leads me to the MAILMILL software at <a href="http://www.metamagix.net/mailmill.html">http://www.metamagix.net/mailmill.html</a>. MAILMILL is free for non-commercial use. Commercial users of MAILMILL must pay registration fee to Metamagix OEG
