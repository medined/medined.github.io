<p>Use the <code>vi</code> editor to modify the <code>.gnome2/accelsgedit</code>. Editing the file with <code>gedit</code> does not work; the changes are not saved. I had reassigned my <code>^s</code> key away from File>Save. I order to get the key assignment back, I re-commented the following line:
<pre>(gtk_accel_path "&lt;Actions&gt;/GeditWindowActions/FileSave" "&lt;Control&gt;s")</pre></p>
