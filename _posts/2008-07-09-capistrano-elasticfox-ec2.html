<p>What a nice combination of tools! I just installed Capistrano and created a <code>capfile</code>. From then on, I could run commands across all my virtual istances in one shot. This setup took just minutes. The only change that I made to my existing instances was to add a <code>capistrano</code> userid. My <code>capfile</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre>role :files, 
  "capistrano@ec2-75-101-225-105.compute-1.amazonaws.com", 
  "capistrano@ec2-67-202-59-118.compute-1.amazonaws.com"

namespace :files do
  desc "Show free disk space"
  task :show_free_space, :roles => :files do
    run "df -h /"
  end
end
</pre>

<p>The best thing of all? No XML configuration!</p>
