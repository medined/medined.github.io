<p>In general, a development framework allows programmers to focus on the unique aspects of an application. Many frameworks have been developed over
the years - even the Radio Shack Model I; back in 80's had a framework to make adding new DOS commands easy (provided you knew assembly language).
Microsoft developed a framework called MFC for Windows. Today there are several frameworks for ColdFusion; CFObject and Fusebox are perhaps the
most well-known.</p>

<strong>Language Independence</strong>

<p>I freely switch between several languages (Java, ColdFusion, and Perl being my current favorites) on a near daily basis. Therefore, the
framework that I use should be able to be duplicated in any language.</p>

<strong>Application Independence</strong>

<p>The application code should be totally unaware of the framework. When a developer sits down to create a feature or to maintain code, she should
not have to worry about what the framework is doing. In other words, the framework should be loosely coupled to the application.</p>

<strong>Simple</strong>

<p>Since I work in so many different environments I want to use a framework with as few rules as possible. I don't want to remember a large set of 
guidelines as I'm coding. No programming "tricks" that need explaining should be used.</p>

<strong>Generic</strong>

<p>All code in the framework should be relevant for *all* situations. Application-specific code should be delegated to include files. And those 
files should be generically named like [application]_init.cfm or [application]_pre_action.cfm or [application]_post_action.cfm.</p>

<strong>Data-Driven Decisions</strong>

<p>Whenever possible, function points in an application should be replaced by dynamic data. For example, instead of a switch or if statement to determine
a hard-coded color, use a hash table (a structure) with the switch expression as the key. This approach can potentially increase the scalability 
of your program, but more importantly increases its flexibility. During run-time, a new hash entry can be created to accomodate a new value for
your expression. If a switch statement is used, a new version of the template needs to be coded, tested, and released.</p>

<p>Sometimes predefining data is not possible, and that's ok. Also sometimes the various combinations of parameters such as security and 
time-of-day are too complex and using an algorithm is better then using data. Obviously some programmer judgement will be needed.</p>
