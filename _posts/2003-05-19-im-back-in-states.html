I'm back in the states. My marketing trip to France seemed successful. Part of my long-term plans include making contacts in the Wine Tourism sector. I believe this trip accomplished this goal by providing an introduction to well-regarded Wine Writer, Robin Garr and to two food and wine tour operators. Additionally, I met a winery owner from Canada and several business owners from across the United States.
