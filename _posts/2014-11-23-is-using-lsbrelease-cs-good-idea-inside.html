Update from Jan 2015: The Zulu team added formal Debian support last October, I just did not know about it. Look at the version history for Zulu 8.4,  7.7, and 6.6 at http://www.azulsystems.com/zulurelnotes. Also look on DockerHub for their 8.4.x Docker files. They don't use lsb_release -cs in Debian Dockerfiles anymore, and instead allow the Zulu repository to honor 'stable' as release name. 'stable' always pushes the highest level for a Java major version. - I am paraphrasing the comments from Matthew Schuetze below.<br />
<br />
I saw the following line in a Dockerfile<br />
<br />
<pre>RUN echo "deb http://repos.azulsystems.com/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zulu.list
</pre><br />
The lsb_release program is not part of the wheezy standard programs. But we can install it:<br />
<br />
<pre>$ apt-get update && apt-get install -y lsb
</pre><br />
How many files were created by that install?<br />
<br />
<pre>$ docker diff 09 | wc -l
30013
</pre><br />
Over 30,000 files!<br />
<br />
I next tried being a bit more specific with<br />
<br />
<pre>$ apt-get update && apt-get install -y lsb-release
</pre><br />
How many files were created by that install?<br />
<br />
<pre>$ docker diff 23 | wc -l
1689
</pre><br />
I conclude that hard-coding "wheezy" is better than using lsb_release in a Dockerfile. At least when using Debian as the base operating system.<br />
