I hardly believe it's 2014 and I've run into an issue that a web search didn't quickly solve.<br />
<br />
@RequestMapping(value = "/district/{name}", method = RequestMethod.GET)<br />
public String communityHandler(Model model, @PathVariable String districtName) ... {<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Notice the mismatch between {name} and the PathVariable? Yeah, it took me too long to spot the difference.</div>
