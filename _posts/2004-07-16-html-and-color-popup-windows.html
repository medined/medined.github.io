The guys at Visibone have created some neat popup windows.  From their site: The <b>HTML Popup</b> is a tall skinny on-screen quick reference showing all HTML tags and attributes in use or universal. It includes color-coded indications of support by Netscape®, Microsoft® Internet Explorer and W3C®, plus style sheet alternatives, and bug and clash icons with details online. The <b>Color Popups</b> show all 216 web-safe colors in a wheel.
