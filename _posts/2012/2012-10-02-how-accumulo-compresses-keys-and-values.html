From the <code>Acccumulo User</code> mailing list, Keith T said:<br />
<blockquote>There are two levels of compression in Accumulo.  First redundant<br />
parts of the key are not stored.  If the row in a key is the same as<br />
the previous row, then its not stored again.   The same is done for<br />
columns and time stamps.   After the relative encoding is done a block<br />
of key values is then compressed with gzip.


As data is read from an RFile, when the row of a key is the same as<br />
the previous key it will just point to the previous keys row.  This is<br />
carried forward over the wire.  As keys are transferred, duplicate<br />
fields in the key are not transferred.<br />
</blockquote><br />
General consensus seemed to favor <bold>double compression</bold> - compression both at the application level (i.e., compress the values) and let Accumulo compress as well (i.e., the relative encoding).<br />
<br />
In support of double compression, Ameet K. said:<br />
<blockquote>I've switched to double compression as per previous posts and<br />
its working nicely. I see about 10-15% more compression over just<br />
application level Value compression.<br />
</blockquote>
