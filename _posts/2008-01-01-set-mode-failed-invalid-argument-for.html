I am trying to get the wireless networking working on Fedora installed into my HP dv9000 laptop when I ran into this error. The problem was caused because the system was trying to set the wireless mode to be <b>AUTO</b> instead of <b>MANAGED</b>.


Update: I ran the <tt>iwlist</tt> command and found out the information that I needed to get the wireless connection working.

<pre>
[root@localhost network-scripts]# <b>/sbin/iwlist wlan0 scan</b>
wlan0     Scan completed :
          Cell 01 - Address: 00:16:B6:1F:2B:CC

The important bits are bolded - the ESSID, Mode, and Channel. Use the <tt>system-config-network</tt> command to set the properties of the <tt>wlan0</tt> connection.

I'm publishing this blog from my laptop via a wireless connection so I know my system is now working correctly.
