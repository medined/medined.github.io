<p>As I mentioned in other entries, I like to use UUID values. The current version of RIFE doesn't handle UUID properties correctly. However, a few minutes digging into the source code showed me that the changes needed for support where trivial.</p>

<p>I created a com.uwyn.rife.database.types.databasedrivers package in my own project and then copied the org_hsqldb_jdbcDriver.java into it.Then I updated the getSqlType() method by added the highlighted code shown below immediately after the test for the character class.</p>

<pre>
  else if (type == java.util.UUID.class) {
    return "VARCHAR(36)";
  }
</pre>

<p>I'd love for this change to be propagated to the rest of the driver files and slipped into an upcoming release.</p>
