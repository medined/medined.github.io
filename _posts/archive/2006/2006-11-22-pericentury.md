<p>I ran into this word in a well-written article by Natalie Angier. Since I like to learn new words, I looked for the
    definition of <i>pericentury</i>. But was unable to find it easily. Fortnately, I was able to track it down.</p>

<p><b>Peri</b> as a prefix means <i>around</i>. Therefore <b>pericentury</b> means <b>around a century</b>. This
    definition makes sense to me since about a 100 years is the maximum human lifespan. Therefore, in the context of the
    article, you have a pericentury of consciousness alloted to you.</p>
