I've been deploying applications to WebSphere using the Administrative Console. Updating a war file requires clicking
through 11 pages, 10 of which I just accept the default values. So I downloaded the Selenium IDE and recorded the
action. Then I replayed the script. In literally three minutes, I had a working script so that updating the war file is
now just a one-click operation.
