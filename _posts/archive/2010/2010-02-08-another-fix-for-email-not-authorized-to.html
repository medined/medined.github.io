<p>I wanted to change the primary email associated with my Heroku account. So I removed the email from the authorization list. The next time I pulled from git, I got the following error:</p>

<pre>heroku@david-medinets.otherinbox.com not authorized to access crisiscamp-translation</pre>

The email address is pulled from your public/private keys which can be recreated using the following command:

<pre>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C EMAIL</pre>
