<p>I spent this past Monday at a one-day conference devoted to how Information Technology
    responded to the humanitarian responses of the past year (Katrina, the Tsunami, Darfur, and
    Afghanistan). For me, the best aspect of the conference was listening to the success stories. One memorable story
    involves using PDAs to collect information which could be easily collected by the main office.</p>


<p>I re-learned that field conditions are vastly inferior to the conditions under which applications are developed. It's
    extremely difficult to get *any* kind of staff in locations such as Darfur and even when staff is hired, turnover is
    very high which pushing training costs higher.</p>

<p>As expected, Data Sharing and Data Standards are a big concern. Yahoo is starting to analyze the existing standards
    with an eye towards how they can be used for First Responders and other aid workers.</p>

<p>There are fledging open-source applications that are being written (such as Sahana at
    http://sahana.sourceforge.net/). Plone (http://plone.org/) is being used as a content-management system by several
    organizations.</p>

<p>In conclusion, at $150 for the day the conference was well worth my time. I highly suggest attending such a
    conference just to get exposed to how another set of people (non-profit, disaster response teams) do their work.</p>
