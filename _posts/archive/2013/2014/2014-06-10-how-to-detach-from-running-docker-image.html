How to Detach From a Running Docker Image


Here is another quick note. This time about Docker.<br />
<br />
<pre># Run the standard Ubuntu image
docker run --name=bash -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

# Do something
...

# Detach by typing Ctl-p and Ctl-q.

# Look at the image while on the Host system.
docker ps

# Reattach to the Ubuntu image
docker attach bash
</pre><br />
While experimenting with these commands, I noticed that I needed to press <ENTER> to see the prompt after the ^P^Q combination and after reattaching.<br />
