When I just installed JBoss it was configured to use Oracle. However, JBoss Portal did not work immediately. I needed to perform the following steps:


1. Copy the Oracle JDBC jar file to [JBOSS.HOME]/server/default/lib.

2. Create database sequences:

<code>create sequence hibernate_sequence;
create sequence portal_seq;
create sequence sec_seq;
create sequence instance_seq;
create sequence portlet_seq;
create sequence user_seq;
</code>
I'm not sure when Hibernate didn't create these sequences automatically. I may be an issue specific to Oracle since I don't recall the same problem when using other databases.

UPDATE: JBoss Portal did not automatically create the sequences because I did not copy the Oracle JDBC jar file into the JBOSS.HOME/lib directory <span style="font-style: italic;">immediately</span> after the installation process completed.
