We are using the hibernate.default_schema property with Oracle in production. Today I tried to use HSQL for our integration tests. When I blanked the hibernate.default_schema property, Hibernate tried to create tables named like '.FOO' - notice that pesky leading period!

You can workaround this issue for HSQL by setting hibernate.default_schema to 'sa'.
