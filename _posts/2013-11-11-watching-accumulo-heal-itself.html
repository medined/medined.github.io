Watching Accumulo heal itself was exciting - prove of technology stuff.


1. Start a cluster with a master and two nodes using https://github.com/medined/Accumulo_1_5_0_By_Vagrant.<br />
<br />
2. Visit http://affy-master:50095/ to verify that two tablet servers are running.<br />
<br />
3. Enable auto-refresh.<br />
<br />
4. Run 'vagrant destroy slave1'<br />
<br />
5. Visit  http://affy-master:50095/. In a minute or two you should see one Dead Tablet Server. You'll also see messages on the Recent Logs page.<br />
<br />
6. Run 'vagrant up slave1'<br />
<br />
7. Run 'vagrant ssh slave1 -c /vagrant/files/post_spinup_setup_ssh.sh' to re-establish SSH public keys.<br />
<br />
8. Run 'vagrant ssh master -c "accumulo_home/bin/accumulo/bin/start-all.sh"' to re-start the Accumulo processes on slave1.<br />
<br />
9. Visit http://affy-master:50095/. In a minute or two you should have both Tablet Servers alive and responding to requests. <br />
