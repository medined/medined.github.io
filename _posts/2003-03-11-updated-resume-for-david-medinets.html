I spoke with TunaRez last night about my resume. They made a few suggestions that sounded good. So I've updated my resume at <a href="http://affy.blogspot.com/dmm_resume/resume.htm">http://affy.blogspot.com/dmm_resume/resume.htm</a>. You'll notice that I've removed all graphics, added an Objective and Summary section, moved the Skills List towards the beginning and consolidated many of the entries into my consulting company. These changes reduced the page count to three from six. Let me know if you like the changes.
