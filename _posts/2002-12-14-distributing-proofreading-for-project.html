Yesterday I found a fascinating subproject associated with Project Gutenberg. The concept of distributed proofreading is elegantly simple and seems perfectly suited to the Internet.


Each page is in two frames - the left is the scanned image and the right is the text gleaned from the image. The proofreaders job is to verify that the text matches the images. Most pages only take a couple of minutes to proof. And you can just proof one per session if you like. Therefore, this project is perfect when you need a five minute break at work or home. Check 'em out!
