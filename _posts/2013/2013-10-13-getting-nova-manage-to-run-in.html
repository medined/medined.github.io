While working to install OpenStack in a VirtualBox Ubuntu instance I ran into an issue running the 'nova-manage version' command.


 The error was of the form:<br />
<br />
Failed to parse /etc/nova/nova.conf ... No ':' or '=' found in assignment<br />
<br />
The resolution was fairly easy. Some of the parameters needed True or False values.<br />
<br />
Apparently an older version of nova-manage used both name and value in the configruation. But a newer version wants just the name. (or vice versa - it's not clear to me).<br />
<br />
I assigned True or False to each parameter that produced an error message. About five of them. I choose True or False at whim. When no more errors were reported, the program reported the following version:<br />
<br />
2013.1.3
