I bought the RocketFish RF-FLBTAD bluetooth dongle today. When it was plugged into the front USB ports of my computer, the dongle would not be recognized as an HCI device. However, when I plugged it into one of the USB ports in the back of my computer, it registered just fine. Lots of good messages in /var/log/syslog.

Update: The dongle disappeared when I rebooted. However, it came back when I manually ran:

<code>sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart</code>
