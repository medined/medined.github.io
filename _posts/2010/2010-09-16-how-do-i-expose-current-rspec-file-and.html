My goal with this monkey patch was to expose the rspec filename and description as global variables so that my exception handling code can know which rspec test caused the exception.


<pre>module Spec
  module Example
    module ExampleMethods
      alias :old_execute execute
      def execute(run_options, instance_variables)
        $rspec_location = @_proxy.location
        $rspec_description = description
        old_execute(run_options, instance_variables)
      end
    end
 end
end</pre>
