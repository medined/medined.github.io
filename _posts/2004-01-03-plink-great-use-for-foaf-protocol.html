<a href="http://affy.blogspot.com/david_mark_medinets.foaf">david_mark_medinets.foaf</a> - Don Ramsey has created a nice site that uses the information in FOAF files. And http://www.ldodds.com/wordtin/Wiki.jsp?page=FOAFaMaticMark2 has a Java-based FOAF editor so that you no longer have an excuse for your FOAF file to be out of date.
