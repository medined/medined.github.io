<p>About a year ago Aizat Faiz, a software developer in Malaysia wrote a blog entry about using ActiveRecord outside of the Rails framework. This is definitely something that I want to do for a variety of reasons, the simplest being that I'd like to write utility programs that access the database without needing to also write a user interface for them.</p>

<p>In any case, Aizat wrote a nice understandable entry. However, he seemed to make the assumption that developers using ActiveRecord without Rails would not have a Rails application at all. This is not the case for me.</p>

<p>If your utility script resides in the top level directory, then you can use your already existing database.yml file instead of creating a new one. Just use the following as a guide.</p>
<pre>dbconfig = YAML::load(File.open('config/database.yml'))
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(dbconfig['development'])</pre>

<p>Also, there is no reason to have your models in your script when they are already in your Rails application. You can load existing modesl like this:</p>

<pre>require 'app/models/event.rb'
require 'app/models/senator.rb'</pre>

<p>That's it. Very simple and no duplication of code.</p>
