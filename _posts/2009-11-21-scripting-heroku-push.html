Scripting the Heroku Push


<p>This tip falls under the KISS principle. I recently started using the Heroku service to run some Rails websites. After making changes and committing them to your local Git repository, those changes are pushed to Heroku using the command <code>git push heroku master</code>. Since I'm likely to forget and since it's four words I created a file called <code>script/push</code> with that command. Here are the steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a file called script/push with one line: <code>git push heroku master</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>chmod +x script/push</code></li>
<li>Run <code>git add script/push</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>git commit -m "scripting the Heroku push"</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>script/push</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. Just <code>script/push</code> whenever you need to deploy.</p>
