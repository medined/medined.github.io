<a href="http://monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop</a> - I am doing pro-bono work for a local non-profit (<a href="http://hopeandahome.org/">Hope and a Home</a>) that has a GoDaddy Windows-based account. I, of course, only have Ubuntu running at home. A short web search found MonoDevelop. Ten minutes later, I had written by first ASP application. Easy to install and easy to use - highly recommended!
