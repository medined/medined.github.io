<p>Normally, I eschew public commentary on this blog but today I read a blog entry that moved me deeply. The <i>Belmont Club</i> blog doesn't list its writer's name but he certainly knows how to write. At the end of a note about terrorists attacking Iraqi police targets he says:
<blockquote>"That when dying and bleeding, beset by the flower of terrorism, with pistol to set against automatic rifle and grenade, the Iraqi police did not ask for help from 82nd Airborne. They asked for ammunition."</blockquote></p>
<p>How proud the mothers and fathers of those policemen must be.</p>
