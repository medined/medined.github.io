The Company where I was consulting closed their doors yesterday due to a combination of factors. Few, if any, were related to the application development work that was being done. I can recommend several of the staff so if you are looking for graphic designers, html writers, ColdFusion; Java; or Vitria developers let me know and I'll play matchmaker.
