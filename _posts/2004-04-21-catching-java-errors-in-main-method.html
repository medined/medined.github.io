<p>I've been using Java for more years than I care to mention but I never realized that you could <code>catch</code> errors as well as <code>exceptions</code>. So I've just added one more item to my toolbox. My <code>main()</code> method always uses this template:</p>
<pre>
try {
  // do something.
} catch (Error e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
} catch (Exception e) {
  e.printStrackTrace();
} finally {
  System.out.println("Done.");
}
</pre>
<p>Of course, in my real code I use <code>log4j</code> so that the errors are persisted.</p>
