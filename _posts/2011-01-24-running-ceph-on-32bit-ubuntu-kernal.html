DON'T DO IT! I spent several hours setting up three virtual servers - one master and two nodes - to run ceph. When it finally came time to run the cfuse command, I saw this message:

<span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNING: Ceph inode numbers are 64 bits wide, and FUSE on 32-but kernals does not cope well with that situation. Expect to crash shortly.</span>

Sigh.
