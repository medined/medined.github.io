http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html – some quotes pulled from the note are below:<br />
<br />
Test-first fundamentalism is like abstinence-only sex ed: An unrealistic, ineffective morality campaign for self-loathing and shaming.<br />
<br />
Test-first units leads to an overly complex web of intermediary objects and indirection in order to avoid doing anything that's "slow".<br />
<br />
I rarely unit test in the traditional sense of the word, where all dependencies are mocked out, and thousands of tests can close in seconds. It just hasn't been a useful way of dealing with the testing of Rails applications.<br />
<br />
https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/rip-tdd/750840194948847 – Kent Beck, of course, mocks the whole 'TDD is Dead' theme. <br />

p.s. - I wrote this whole post just for that 'mocks' pun.
