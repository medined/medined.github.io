I am investigating the use of embedded Tomcat in one of my projects. During my testing, I ran into an error message:<pre>No Java compiler available</pre> I was unable to find significant information about this message via Google so I downloaded the Tomcat source and poked around. To make a short story shorter, include the following jar files to fix this issue:<pre>TOMCAT_HOME\common\lib\jasper-compiler.jar
TOMCAT_HOME\common\lib\jasper-compiler-jdt.jar</pre>
