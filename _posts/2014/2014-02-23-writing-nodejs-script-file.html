This is a short post about a simple topic but it's one that I hadn't thought about so sharing seems good. I like computer languages that run from back-end processing to front-end web site development. For example, Ruby handles the both environments, but Java doesn't. Today I realized that nodejs can also handle both. And it's simple.


A nodejs script looks like this:<br />
<br />
1. Create a file called helloWorld with the following contents:<br />
<br />
#!/usr/bin/env node<br />console.log("Hello World.");<br />
<br />
2. chmod +x helloWorld<br />
<br />
3. ./helloWorld<br />
<br />
Of course, you have the full power of javascript and nodejs to play with.<br />
<br />
Have fun!
