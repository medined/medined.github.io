<p>Using the rails installed by apt-get was a bit confusing because the rails project being generated was not the rails version that I expected. I had installed the rails gem v2.2.2 but the config/environment.rb file showed rails v2.1.</p>

<p>I fixed this issue by removing the default rails.</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get remove rails</pre>

<p>And then using an alias:</p>

<pre>export GEMDIR=`gem environment gemdir`
export RAILS_VERSION=`gem list rails | grep "rails " | cut -b8- | awk '{sub(/\)/, "");print}'`
alias rails='ruby $GEMDIR/gems/rails-$RAILS_VERSION/bin/rails'</pre>

<p>Now when I do</p>

<pre>rails dool</pre>

<p>The project uses the right version of rails!</p>
