<p>I ran into the "Second-level cache is not enabled" error recently even though I had the <i>hibernate.cache.use_query_cache</i> and <i>hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache</i> parameters defined as true. The issue was resolved when I <b>also</b> defined the <i>hibernate.cache.provider_class</i> as org.hibernate.cache.EhCacheProvider.</p>
