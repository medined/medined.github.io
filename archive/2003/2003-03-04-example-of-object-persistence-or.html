Several years ago, while I was working for Toysrus.com I created an In-Memory database of their inventory items using ColdFusion. There were about 30,000 parts and ColdFusion was easily able to handle that much memory in their structures. The time-consuming ascept of that project was developing the code to read the information from the database into memory. Today, in Java world, Object Prevalance, makes the same task much easier.


<p>The home page for the Object Prevalence system that I use is <a href="http://www.prevayler.org/wiki.jsp?topic=StartingPoints">http://www.prevayler.org/wiki.jsp?topic=StartingPoints</a>. I won't spend any time describing the concepts, but you can read about them there. I first started looking at Object Persistence technologies because I wanted to write a JarSearcher application. I could search the store for any class. Frequently when I'm compiling someone else's code, I find class references that I'm unfamilar with and don't know which Jar file the class is in. My JarSearcher would pre-search Jar files so that I could quickly find the class that I need. The application works in two steps. First, .jar files are indexed. And then class names are found as needed. You'll find my source code at <a href="http://affy.blogspot.com/JarSearcher.zip">JarSearcher.zip</a>. The docomentation is rather sparse for now. The js.bat file shows how to invoke the application. The java_projects.txt file shows how to create a script for the application to follow. Please send comments to myself at medined@mtolive.com.
