From the Accumulo User mailing list on Oct 10, 2012, John V says:<br />
<blockquote>The scripts start loggers on all of the slave nodes. You can arbitrarily start/stop loggers, but we highly recommend doing 1:1 between them and tservers because the method for assigning tserver->logger does make assumptions depending on that 1:1 correlation.<br />
