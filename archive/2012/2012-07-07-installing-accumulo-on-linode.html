I updated my github playground with steps to install Accumulo on a Linode server. The whole process, from buying the server to running the Accumulo shell, took less than 30 minutes. The steps are located at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/medined/accumulo_playground/blob/master/README_LINODE.txt">https://github.com/medined/accumulo_playground/blob/master/README_LINODE.txt</a>.
