The bound volumes of the United States Reports contain the fourth and final 
generation of the Court's opinions. See the file entitled "Information About 
Opinions." However, the materials collected here contain not just opinions, 
but the full text, from cover through index, of bound volumes 502 et seq., 
including all of the opinions, orders, and other materials issued for the 
Court's 1991 Term and subsequent years. Additional volumes will be included 
here after they are published in print form.
