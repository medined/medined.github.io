  <P>This book is based on the learn-by-doing principle because I believe that
  simply reading about some subjects isn't enough. After all, you don't read
  about putting together a jigsaw puzzle, you put the puzzle together yourself!
  Programming is the same way. You must actually run some programs in order to
  really understand the concepts. </P>
  <P><I>Perl 5 by Example</I> teaches you how to use the Perl programming
  language by showing examples that demonstrate the concepts being discussed.
  The examples are designed to give you a chance to experiment-which in turn
  should clarify the material. </P></FONT>- <I>excerpt from the <A

<H2>Dedication</H2>To my wife, Kathryn - <I>David</I> <A
name="About the Author"></A>
<H2>About the Author</H2><B>David Medinets</B> has been programming since 1980,
when he starting with a TRS-80 Model 1. He still fondly remembers the days when
he could cross-wire the keyboard to create funny-looking characters on the
display. Since those days, he has spent time debugging Emacs on UNIX machines,
working on VAXen, and messing around with DOS microcomputers. David is married
to Kathryn and lives in Northwest New Jersey. He runs Eclectic Consulting and
has co-authored <I>Special Edition, Using Lotus Notes Release 4 (Que)</I>,<I>
Special Edition, Using Turbo C++ 4.5 for Windows (Que)</I>, <I>Microsoft Office
95 Unleashed (SAMS)</I>, and <I>Visual Basic Unleashed (SAMS)</I> among others.

<H2>Acknowledgements</H2>I'd like to thank all of the people at Que for making
this book possible. You'll find their names listed on the Credits page so I
won't list them all here. Susan Ross Moore deserves special thanks for
figuratively watching over my shoulder as I worked. Her comments definitely made
this a better book. Al Valvano was instrumental in making sure that everything
came together at the proper time.
<P>My wonderful wife deserves some thanks for letting me hang out on the
Internet at all hours of the day and night while I did research for this book.
<P>While writing this book, I have gleaned information from many books,
articles, and web resources. Where a particular item greatly influenced my
thinking, I have given credit in the appropriate section.
<P>Dale Bewley helped to create Chapter 19, "What is CGI?" - Thanks Dale!
<P>And, of course, no Perl author should forget to thank: Larry Wall for
creating Perl in the first place; Tom Christiansen for his remarkable
contributions to the Perl community; and Randal Schwartz for his <I>Learning
Perl</I> book which every Perl programmer seems to have read. <A
